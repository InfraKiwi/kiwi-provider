# Quickstart

This quickstart example shows you how to craft a recipe that you can use to install haproxy on a Debian/Ubuntu machine, to serve a single static page.

kiwi has various components that are needed for the whole architecture to work together, but we can get a "development" run of it with just the basic command line client.

What we'll do:

1. Create the recipe to install haproxy on the machine
2. Run the recipe!

What you need:

1. The [kiwi CLI](TODO)
2. A Debian/Ubuntu machine (or otherwise, a machine with `apt` and `systemd` available)

## The recipe
