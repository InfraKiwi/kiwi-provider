# Roadmap

Steps still needed for an MVP:

- [ ] Support for bootstrap phase in recipes targets **WIP**
- [ ] Assets distribution via S3 API
- [ ] Binaries distribution by default via GH releases
  - [ ] Example of boostrap recipe that installs binary on linux and updates the binary
- [ ] Some example of auth for hosts
