`kiwi-provider` is a prototype of a pull-based task execution system. Think of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), but
instead of pushing config from one machine to n-others, the others run an agent that pulls the config from a centralized
repo. Kinda like [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/), but hopefully a bit more modern!

The dream is for this project to configure some bare-metal machines worldwide!

## Notes from the author

The author of this project is [Alberto Marchetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertomarchetti/).

The code is (and will be for some good time) disorderly and continuously evolving.
I work on this project in my free time, so it may take uncountable days before it is in any ready/usable state.
Also, commits may get squashed occasionally to clean up WIPs.

If you want to support me, you can buy me an espresso on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/cmaster11)!
